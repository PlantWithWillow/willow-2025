Do you need to water it, or hold off for fear of overwatering? Is it the right soil temperature? A simple reading doesn’t consider seasonality, time of day, or how long your plant’s been sitting at 40%. All these considerations and more are critical to happy, healthy houseplants, and Willow factors it all in.</p>",
